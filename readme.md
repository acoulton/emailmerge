EmailMerge Library
====================

Â© 2011 Andrew Coulton - released under the [Kohana license](http://kohanaframework.org/license)

The EmailMerge library provides a full implementation of creating user-customisable
emails based on a template and some data. Think MS Word MailMerge meets Kohana -
complete with the option to customise individual emails prior to sending.

For more, see the userguide docs.
